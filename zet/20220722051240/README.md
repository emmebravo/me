I'm rewatching Rob's Boost VODs, https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrK9UeDMcQLpkdoPTNG7nSBA6Bb4AoJX1 --does YT need a link shortener or **what**? Anyway, I'm rewatching the VODs bc I fell behind and honestly didn't keep up the practice, so gotta get back on my horse. Trying to do this zettelkasten thing, IDK if this is how it's supposed to be, tbh LMAO Anyway, I'm on Week 1 video and Rob said something that I truly connected to:
> "The answer to the world's woes is not more censorship according to some particular standard. The answer to the world's woe is to learn how to filter out the bad stuff, whether it is historical text or fake news on Twitter." --@rwxrob, 2022 Boost

I feel this is incredibly important, especially in the current political climate in which we're living. A lot of the time, "liberals" call for the censorship of mean comments by right-wingers. Making Twitter the arbiter of what is, or is not, free speech is a mistake. Not just Twitter, but any corporation, business, especially social media giants. As a leftist, I've seen this effort to "protect" free speech come back and affect leftist media more than anything else.

RWX (read, write, execute) has garner a new meaning for me.

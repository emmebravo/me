# I need a remembrall

Not really, I just need to zettel everything. I've become a believer! I'm on Week 2 of the boost, and Rob's going over UNIX/Linux--one major difference is one has an 'L' lmao Cool thing he just mentioned, and I'd forgotten from the first view, is the C language was invented so the second version of UNIX could be developed. The first version of UNIX was built with Assembly, and that was way too hard, so C was invented to make things easier. The more I learn, the more I realize I don't know. It's fun yet a tad terrifying bc I don't have a clear picture of what it all means. Like when I was learning JavaScript: I couldn't picture myself how I would start anything. "A `function` just magically goes here? But why? Like, what?" I think in pictures, so the picture in my head at moment is vast but a bit jumbled. OK, a lot jumbled, but I'm trusting the process.

Anyway, a more concise differentiation of UNIX vs Linux is UNIX was created by AT&T Bell Labs, and it's proprietary. It used to cost $3k ($19.5k in today's dollars) to get a seat to use it when it first came out. Then Andrew Tanenbaum created Minix bc he wanted to teach OSes. Then Linus Torvalds created Linux, based off Minix, bc he couldn't afford a UNIX OS and wanted to make a better version of Minix. Linux is just a kernel and GNU are the commands used to communicate with it. It's technically called GNU/Linux, but it's mostly just referred as Linux.
